- Implement enhancer removal by inversion
- more user friendly output file that indicates only the most relevant information: Variant Name, most likely effect mechanism, gene (with score), enhancer.
- Gene phenotype permutation: permutate all genes, not only phenotype associated ones
- Patient phenotype permutation: Optional, assigne randomly a phenotype from other target term group
- finish GUI
- automatically build GUI .jar version
- test GUI on Windows
- Parser for inversions from Delly VCF files
- Inversion break-point in genes as coding variant alternative

MINOR:
- compute TAD boundaries directly from GenomicSet of TADs
- report filtering rate against benign CNVs in log file or separate stats file.
- User Logging classes
